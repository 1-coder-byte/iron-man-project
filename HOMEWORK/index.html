        <p>Scarlet Witch is the most powerful Avenger. We will shout this from the rooftops if we have to! With the power of telekinesis, she can move anything (and we mean anything) by the wave of a hand. Her individual fight with Thanos in the MCU showcased the most power out of any of the Avengers by far.Despite her mistakes throughout WandaVision, fans still regard Scarlet Witch as a hero and sympathize with her after she lost everyone she loved. ... Wanda was hostile to any attempt to help her realize she was hurting the innocent people of Westview until the villain Agatha Harkness shattered Wanda's delusions.</p>

        <p>Wanda Maximoff, also known as Scarlet Witch, is a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro.</p>
